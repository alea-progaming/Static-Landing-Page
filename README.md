### Wireframe
This is a hand-drawn wireframe that outlines the basic structure and layout of a webpage for a seasonal drink and food promotion. This wireframe serves as a blueprint for the design and helps in visualizing the arrangement of content before actual development begins.

### UI Design
These images show the final UI design based on the wireframe, forming a cohesive seasonal drink promotion webpage. The top section includes the logo, navigation menu, hero section with a featured drink, and a secondary promotion with an "Order now" button. The bottom section features another promotional item, a contact form, an "About Me" section, social media links, and copyright information. This design translates the wireframe into a functional and visually appealing webpage layout.
